* About

This script can be used to install and keep updated the official linux
builds of [[https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/][Firefox]] and [[https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/][Thunderbird]]. Regular releases, betas and ESR
(Firefox only) are supported.

As of time of writing, the builds [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/91.0/system-requirements/][require]] =glibc 2.17=. It means for
example Ubuntu 14.04 is the oldest supported Ubuntu and Debian 8 is
the oldest supported Debian. With that limitation in mind the script
requires at least =bash 4.3=

* Installation

The only required step is creating the [[#base-dir][base dir]].

With =lbzip2= installed you can significantly speed up decompression
of downloaded packages.

* Usage

#+begin_example
  mozilla-update [--lang <lang>] [--base <dir>] <package>
  mozilla-update --download [--lang <lang>] <package>
  mozilla-update --install [--base <dir>] <file>
  mozilla-update --select [--base <dir>] <package>
  mozilla-update --list-langs <package>
  mozilla-update [--no-path] --desktop-file <package>
#+end_example

** Packages

- firefox
- firefox-beta
- firefox-esr
- thunderbird
- thunderbird-beta

** Base dir

The script installs packages into the /base dir/, by default
=/opt/mozilla=. With =-b <dir>= / =--base <dir>= you can set a custom
base dir.

*The script doesnt create the base dir*, you should create it yourself.

With some packages installed, the base dir layout looks like this:

#+begin_example
  firefox -> firefox-91.0
  firefox-78.12.0esr
  firefox-90.0.1
  firefox-90.0.2
  firefox-91.0
  firefox-91.0esr
  firefox-esr -> firefox-91.0esr
  thunderbird-91.0b6
  thunderbird-beta -> thunderbird-91.0b6
#+end_example

As you see there are multiple versions of some packages and some of
those are targeted by non-versioned symlinks. You can interactively
retarget the symlinks with =-s= / =--select= mode described below.

The script doesnt remove anything from the base dir, upgrades just
pile up there. You might want to delete outdated versions there from
time to time.

** Languages

Mozilla provides packages in many languages. By default the script
uses =en-US= one. You can set a custom lang with =-l <lang>= / =--lang
<lang>=. Use =--list-langs= option described below to list available
languages for a package.

** Modes

The script runs in such modes:

- usage mode :: If run without any args, just show the usage text.

- =-d= / =--download= :: Download the latest version of a package into
  the current dir if only an update is available and verify the
  signature.

  Example: =mozilla-update -d firefox=

- =-i= / =--install= :: Install a previously downloaded archive into
  the base dir.

  Example: =mozilla-update -i firefox-91.0.tar.bz2=

- =-s= / =--select= :: Interactively select version for a package's
  symlink in the base dir.

  Example: =mozilla-update -s firefox=

- =--list-langs= :: List available languages for the latest version of a
  package.

  Example: =mozilla-update --list-langs firefox=

- =--desktop-file= :: Generate a desktop file for the package. By
  default the =Exec= property contains a full path to the binary. With
  =--no-path= it would be just a package name like =firefox= or
  =firefox-esr=.

Example: =mozilla-update --desktop-file firefox=

- upgrade mode :: If none of the above were used, try to upgrade (or
  install) a package and refresh its symlink in the base dir in the
  case. *This is what the most users would use.*

  Example: =mozilla-update firefox=

* FAQ

- Why not just use Mozilla stuff bundled with distro X? :: There are
  outdated systems like Ubuntu 14.04 which are still used and recieve
  some kind of support (Ubuntu [[https://ubuntu.com/security/esm][ESM]]) but the updates no longer cover
  Firefox and Thunderbird.

- But there are snaps, flatpaks :: One more option to chose
  from. Besides one might want to run Firefox under [[https://github.com/netblue30/firejail][firejail]] which is
  not possible in combination with those sandboxing solutions.

- Why not use built-in Firefox/Thunderbird upgrades :: I dont like the
  idea of self modifying software especially in case of a browser.

- Why there is no thunderbird-esr package :: Thunderbird ESR is
  discontinued since 2014. Thunderbird tracks Firefox ESR [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar][schedule]]
  instead.
